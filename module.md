# CSE 310 - Module Report

Name: Austin Jones

## Part 1 - Module Planning

This section should be filled on the first Monday of the Sprint and submitted

### Section 1.1 - Module Selection

1. What Sprint is this for (1-5)?
         Sprint 2

2. Select the Module (with a single X) that you will do this Sprint:

|Module                   |Selected Module|
|-------------------------|---------------|
|Cloud Databases          |               |
|Data Analysis            |               |
|Game Framework           |               |
|GIS Mapping              |               |
|Mobile App               |               |
|Networking               |               |
|SQL Relational Databases |               |
|Web Apps                 |               |
|C++                      |       x       |
|Java                     |               |
|Kotlin                   |               |
|Erlang                   |               |
|TypeScript               |               |
|Rust                     |               |
|Choose Your Own Adventure|               |

3. Find the list of unique requirements for your selected module in the Module Summary in Canvas.  In some circumstances, you will need to modify the requirements based on the technology or language you selected.  For the Choose Your Own Adventure, you need to create your own requirements.  List the unique module requirements below:

Unique Requirements & Stretch Challenges
Write one or more programs in C++ that demonstrates some of the following:

Variables

Expressions

Conditionals

Loops

Functions

Classes

Data structure from STL (such as a vector, list, or map)

Stretch Challenges (select one):

Modify your program to read and write to a file.

Modify your program to demonstrates inheritance with virtual functions.

Modify your program to use the new and delete operators to dynamically create objects.

### Section 1.2 - Planning

During the Sprint, you will spend 4 hours in class meetings, 4 hours on your team project (2 of which during class), and 10 hours on your selected module.  Make a plan for your 10 hours by answering the questions below.  You should refer back to this plan and make adjustments during the Sprint.

1. What sources have you selected to learn the technical material?

ChatGpt, Youtube, Bro. Macbeths Tutorials

2. What is your plan to practice the new material?  In other words, what is the order in which you plan to learn the material before working on your demonstration software?

I want to lookover Brother Macbeths tutorial videos and possibly some youtube videos. 

3. What demonstration software do you plan on submitting at the end of the Sprint (note that this can and may change)?

I see myself showing the unique requirements and a stretch would be to make a game of some sort it c++ but it'd be a mini game.

4. Identify the days, times, and locations that you will work on the module.

I want to work more on tuesdays thursdays cause they're very open for me. Might work on it after my mini session of working with my Team

5. Identify both a technical risk and a behavioral risk that you antcipate may occur during this Sprint.  What is your mitgigation plan?

technical risk would be getting to far in tutorial mode rather than building mode of my own. Behavioral risk would be not goin to work on this after my team project meeting. My mitigation plan would be to put comments on my work more so I understand the content more. I think having a reward of a soda or energy drink will help me with the behoviral risk.

## Part 2 - Time Log

This section should be filled out during the Sprint. 

Record all CSE 310 work that you do on your individual module or the team project.  Include time learning, practicing, developing, testing, and documenting.  Don't include time spent in the 4 class meetings (Planning, Stand-Up, Team Review, and Individual Review).  You will need to sum of these hours at the end of the Sprint. Note that the hours you report will affect your grades.

Note that `IM` stands for Individual Module and `TP` stands for Team Project.  

|Date      |Start Time|IM or TP|Description                                 |Hours:Minutes|
|----------|----------|--------|--------------------------------------------|-------------|
|  May 14  | 10:00am  |   TP   |    Planning out gloom coin ideas           |    1 hour   |
|  May 16  | 2:00pm   |   TP   |    Worked on Presentation and functions    |    1 hour   |
|  May 21  | 10:00am  |   TP   |    Finished Presentation, some css         |    1 hour   |
|  May 23  | 1:30pm   |   TP   |    Css animation ideas and firebase works  |    1 hour   |
|  May 22  | 6:00pm   |   IM   |    Tutorials on css and animation          |    4 hour   |
|  May 23  | 6:00pm   |   IM   |    Putting to practice | commenting on css |    4 hour   |



## Part 3 - Module Results

This section should be filled out at the end of the Sprint and submitted.

1. Put your GitHub link for your demonstration software here:

https://github.com/stinojones/Sprint-2 

2. Put your YouTube link for your code walkthrough and demo video here:

https://youtu.be/qOWllhjcaGE

3. Complete the following checklist by either indicating "Yes" or "No". If you indicate "No" then provide an explanation of why beneath the table.

|Question                                                    |Response|
|------------------------------------------------------------|--------|
|Are the links above public and working?                     |  Yes   |
|Did you complete all the unique requirements for the module?|  Yes   |
|Did you write at least 100 lines of code?                   |  Yes   |
|Did you fully complete the readme.md file?                  |  Yes   |
|Did you put the readme.md file in GitHub in the top folder? |  Yes   |

4. If you completed a Stretch Challenge (as shown in the Module Description document in Canvas) then describe what you did.  If you did the Choose Your Own Adventure module, then you get to decide what qualifies as a Stretch Challenge.

5. Did you change your selected module during the middle of the Sprint?  If yes, then describe what you changed it to, when you changed it, and why you changed it.

I switched to a Choose your own adventure of css animation because I think I lacked it and it would be beneficial towards my team project since a lot of the backend is already taken care of. I wanted to add more detail to the front end rather then just colors.

6. Using the log above, fill in the total hours and minutes you spent on the individual module:

|Activity         |Total Hours:Minutes|
|-----------------|-------------------|
|Individual Module|        8          |

7. What strategies (behavioral and technical) worked well during this Sprint?  What did not work well?  List some possible ways that you can improve next Sprint.

What went well was me becoming obsessed of learning the front end animation because it was genuinely fun this sprint. Some things that didn't go well would be turning my assignment in on time because I went on vacation and forgot about the time change haha. But that can be improved next spring by probably turning my assignment in on the friday or thursday of the last week rather than the saturday so then I can enjoy my weekend.
